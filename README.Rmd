`osmdata` is an R package for accessing the data underlying
OpenStreetMap (OSM), delivered via the [Overpass
API](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API).  (Other packages such as
[`OpenStreetMap`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenStreetMap/index.html)
can be used to download raster tiles based on OSM data.)
[Overpass](https://overpass-turbo.eu) is a read-only API that extracts custom
selected parts of OSM data. Data can be returned in a variety of formats,
including as [Simple Features (`sf`)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf),
[Spatial (`sp`)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sp), or [Silicate
(`sc`)](https://github.com/hypertidy/silicate) objects.


## Installation

To install:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install from CRAN 
install.packages("osmdata")

# Alternatively, install the development version
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ropensci/osmdata")
```

To load the package and check the version:
```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(osmdata)
packageVersion("osmdata")
```

## Usage

[Overpass API](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API) queries can be
built from a base query constructed with `opq` followed by `add_osm_feature`. The
corresponding OSM objects are then downloaded and converted to [`R Simple
Features (sf)`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf) objects with
`osmdata_sf()` or to [`R Spatial (sp)`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sp)
objects with `osmdata_sp()`.  For example, 

```{r query-thames, eval=FALSE}
x <- opq(bbox = c(-0.27, 51.47, -0.20, 51.50)) %>% # Chiswick Eyot in London, U.K.
    add_osm_feature(key = 'name', value = "Thames", value_exact = FALSE) %>%
    osmdata_sf()
x
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
msg <- c ("Object of class 'osmdata' with:\n",
"                 $bbox : 51.47,-0.27,51.5,-0.2\n",
"        $overpass_call : The call submitted to the overpass API\n",
"                 $meta : metadata including timestamp and version numbers\n",
"           $osm_points : 'sf' Simple Features Collection with 24548 points\n",
"            $osm_lines : 'sf' Simple Features Collection with 2219 linestrings\n",
"         $osm_polygons : 'sf' Simple Features Collection with 33 polygons\n",
"       $osm_multilines : 'sf' Simple Features Collection with 6 multilinestrings\n",
"    $osm_multipolygons : 'sf' Simple Features Collection with 3 multipolygons")
message (msg)
```

OSM data can also be downloaded in OSM XML format with `osmdata_xml()` and saved
for use with other software.

```r
osmdata_xml(q1, "data.osm")
```

### Bounding Boxes

All `osmdata` queries begin with a bounding box defining the area of the query.
The [`getbb()`
function](https://ropensci.github.io/osmdata/reference/getbb.html) can be used
to extract bounding boxes for specified place names.
```{r getbb-astana}
getbb ("astana kazakhstan")
```
The next step is to convert that to an overpass query object with the [`opq()`
function](https://ropensci.github.io/osmdata/reference/opq.html):
```{r opq}
q <- opq (getbb ("astana kazakhstan"))
q <- opq ("astana kazakhstan") # identical result
```
It is also possible to use bounding polygons rather than rectangular boxes:
```{r getbb-haines}
b <- getbb ("bangalore", format_out = "polygon")
class (b); head (b [[1]])
```

### Features

The next step is to define features of interest using the [`add_osm_feature()`
function](https://ropensci.github.io/osmdata/reference/add_osm_feature.html).
This function accepts `key` and `value` parameters specifying desired features
in the [OSM key-vale schema](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features).
Multiple `add_osm_feature()` calls may be combined as illustrated below, with
the result being a logical AND operation, thus returning all amenities that
are lebelled both as restaurants and also as pubs:
```{r key-val1}
q <- opq ("portsmouth usa") %>%
    add_osm_feature(key = "amenity", value = "restaurant") %>%
    add_osm_feature(key = "amenity", value = "pub") # There are none of these
```
(Logical OR combinations are demonstrated below.) Negation can also be specified
by pre-prending an exclamation mark so that the following requests all amenities
that are NOT labelled as restaurants and that are not labelled as pubs:
```{r key-val2}
q <- opq ("portsmouth usa") %>%
    add_osm_feature(key = "amenity", value = "!restaurant") %>%
    add_osm_feature(key = "amenity", value = "!pub") # There are a lot of these
```

Additional arguments allow for more refined matching, such as the following
requrest for all pubs with "irish" in the name:
```{r key-val3}
q <- opq ("washington dc") %>%
    add_osm_feature(key = "amenity", value = "pub") %>%
    add_osm_feature(key = "name", value = "irish",
                    value_exact = FALSE, match_case = FALSE)
```
See
[`?available_features`](https://ropensci.github.io/osmdata/reference/available_features.html)
and
[`?available_tags`](https://ropensci.github.io/osmdata/reference/available_tags.html)
for further information.


### Data Formats

An overpass query constructed with the `opq()` and `add_osm_feature()`
functions is then sent to the [overpass server](https://overpass-turbo.eu) to
request data. These data may be returned in a variety of formats, currently
including:

1. XML data (downloaded locally) via
   [`osmdata_xml()`](https://ropensci.github.io/osmdata/reference/osmdata_xml.html);
2. [Simple Features (sf)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf) format via
   [`osmdata_sf()`](https://ropensci.github.io/osmdata/reference/osmdata_sf.html);
3. [R Spatial (sp)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sp) format via
   [`osmdata_sp()`](https://ropensci.github.io/osmdata/reference/osmdata_sp.html);
4. [Google Protocol Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)
   (`pbf`; downloaded locally)) via
   [`osmdata_pbf()`](https://ropensci.github.io/osmdata/reference/osmdata_pbf.html);
   and
5. [Silicate (SC)](https://github.com/hypertidy/silicate) format via
   [`osmdata_sc()`](https://ropensci.github.io/osmdata/reference/osmdata_sc.html).


### Additional Functionality

Logical OR combinations can be implemented with the package's internal `c`
method, so that the above example can be extended to all amenities that are
either restaurants OR pubs with
```{r OR-fakey, eval = FALSE}
pubs <- opq ("portsmouth usa") %>%
    add_osm_feature(key = "amenity", value = "pub") %>%
    osmdata_sf()
restaurants <- opq ("portsmouth usa") %>%
    add_osm_feature(key = "amenity", value = "restaurant") %>%
    osmdata_sf()
c (pubs, restaurants)
```
```{r OR, echo = FALSE}
message (paste0 ("Object of class 'osmdata' with:\n",
"                 $bbox : 43.0135509,-70.8229994,43.0996118,-70.7279298\n",
"        $overpass_call : The call submitted to the overpass API\n",
"                 $meta : metadata including timestamp and version numbers\n",
"           $osm_points : 'sf' Simple Features Collection with 325 points\n",
"            $osm_lines : NULL\n",
"         $osm_polygons : 'sf' Simple Features Collection with 24 polygons\n",
"       $osm_multilines : NULL\n",
"    $osm_multipolygons : NULL"))
```


Data may also be trimmed to within a defined polygonal shape with the
[`trim_osmdata()`](https://ropensci.github.io/osmdata/reference/trim_osmdata.html)
function.  Full package functionality is described on the
[website](https://ropensci.github.io/osmdata/)
